Iâ€™m a 4th-year undergraduate student in the department of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, China. My research interests include machine learning and computer vision, especially in the areas of segmentation, retrieval, classification and recognition. I also focus on some projects on Kaggle about data mining. And now I am looking for a Master's position.
