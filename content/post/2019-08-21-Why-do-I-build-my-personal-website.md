## Lesson

> It is always hard to show people the details of my experience or to recall past practices. Always regret the time when I'm ready to appreciate my achievements or brush up on my past knowledge. Lesson again and again let me fully realize the importance of **record**, due to every delay, I miss a lot of important valuable experience, and in the end only remember some. It's a great waste to my experience for years, but I was aware of the existence of the problem, in all kinds of rough way to record something, and this website is the best opportunity to sort out .

## Advantage

> People will have some inspiration from time to time, if you can record the inspiration, then it will be a huge hidden wealth; The experiences I write down may point the way for someone in the world to solve their problems; To be able to rearrange what you have learned in your own language is an effective learning in the true sense; According to the Ebbinghaus curve, we know that people are always forgetting. When I encounter the same problem again, a guide I once recorded will undoubtedly help me in time of need. These benefits tell me a lot about the need for **record**.

## Motivation

> One day my friend showed me his personal website, I was completely attracted by this new thing, there is such a good tool can help us programmers record, and after browsing many excellent foreign personal websites, I urgently need to have a personal website. Since I have mastered Markdown and some experience about using Github, I can easily set up my personal website and write my blog with Jekyll+Github Page, so **record** is not a difficult thing for me.

## Expectation

> It only took me two days to create and optimize the website, but the blog writing and enriching content of the website will cost me a lot of energy and time in the future, but I am willing to spare time to do this, because the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. As for most of the things I missed in the past, I will not go back and re-record them. The past is the past, but there are a few very important things I will re-record. I will carefully record every project and operation experience in the future. If you are also interested in creating a personal website, I will summarize my experience of building a website in my next blog and offer help to you.
